# Doccords

Users can maintain, analyze and share medical documents.

##Getting Started
These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

#Prerequisites
Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push

we need node version 10.0.0 and above or you can download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
you can use `node -v` to check node version

We need npm version 6.0.0 and above - this will be automatcally get installed while installing Node js using installer
you can use `npm -v` to check npm version

Instal VS code, We need VS code IDE to start our development process

### need to install `Prettier` and `ESLint` as VS code package

#Installing
In this section we will tell you step by step process, that will tell you how to get a development environment running

Clone this project repository using
### `git clone https://github.com/Elangodevguy/doccords.git`

after you clone doccords repo, move to the root of the project directory in your terminal

Install both dependency and dev-dependency using
### `npm install`  or  `npm i` 

Setting up local .env
to setup local .env, copy .env file from develop branch.

Run the app in development mode
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#Testing
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
### `npm test`
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#Production-build
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

### `npm run build`
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Other available scripts

#Linting
To lint our entire project expect build folder, we can run 
### `npm run lint`
VS code will automatically tell the places where ESLint rules are getting broke, thanks to `.eslintrc.js` will conatin all the standard rules for our project




<!-- ## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
